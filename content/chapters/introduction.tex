Markus ``Notch" Persson is a Swedish video game programmer and designer. He is most famous for crating the highly praised game Minecraft.

    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig/chapter1/notch_eclipse.png}
    \caption{Blurred image of Minecraft 1.7 changelog from @notch's Tweet}
\end{figure}

The image looks like it is taken inside a text editor or \gls{IDE}. There is a file currently opened, with several other files, or tabs, partially visible at the top of the image. The file that is corrently opened seems to be a changelog for the upcoming 1.7 version of Minecraft, with the new major version written on the first line, followed by a list of changed. The content is mostly burred out, showing only parts of the first letter on each line and the content of some longer lines. The image is also cropped so that the file names for the files that are currently opened in the project is not displayed.
